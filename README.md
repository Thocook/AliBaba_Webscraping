## Future Expansions
### Data Cleaning
To enhance the quality of the extracted data, future expansions could focus on implementing robust data cleaning processes.

Utilizing techniques like outlier detection and handling null values will contribute to a more reliable and accurate dataset.

### Description Extraction
Expanding the scraping functionality to extract product descriptions can provide a more comprehensive view of each item. Descriptions often contain valuable information about product features, specifications, and customer reviews. Incorporating this data into the structured database can enrich the analysis and offer deeper insights into customer preferences and product characteristics.

### Arbitrage Opportunities
For users interested in e-commerce and market analysis, a fascinating expansion could involve comparing the scraped data with Amazon product listings to identify potential arbitrage opportunities. By analyzing pricing differentials and product availability across platforms, users can gain insights into market trends and potentially discover profitable opportunities for buying and selling.
